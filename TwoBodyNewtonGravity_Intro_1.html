    <h1>
      Two-body Newtonian Gravitation
    </h1>
    <p style="margin-top: 0">
      Simulation of Newtonian gravitation for a two-body system. The 
      simulation panel is a visualisation of the motion of the two bodies, the 
      larger one (red) of mass <i>M</i> and the smaller one (blue) of mass <i>m</i>. 
      The first graph plots energy as a function of time. The second graph 
      plots analytic expressions of energy as a function of radial position.

      Instructions
    </h2>
    <p style="margin-top: 0">
      Vary the ratio of masses <i>M/m</i>. You can also vary the initial 
      radial velocity of the smaller (blue) mass. The simulation automatically 
      sets the initial conditions for the larger (red) mass such that the 
      centre of mass (white) is at the centre of the panel and is stationary. 
      The initial tangential velocities are also chosen automatically to 
      default to a circular orbit when the initial radial velocity is zero.
    </p>
    <h2>
      Interpreting the Graphs
    </h2>
    <p style="margin-top: 0">
      In the first graph, the red line is the kinetic energy of the larger 
      (red) mass, while the blue line is the kinetic energy of the smaller 
      (blue) mass. The black line is the gravitational potential energy of 
      their interaction, while the dashed line is the total energy (if shown). 
      These are calculated as the simulation is running.
    </p>

      In the second graph, the analytic form for the effective radial 
      potential is initially shown, as a function of the (radial) distance of 
      the smaller mass from the centre of mass (origin). An exact expression 
      involving <i>m/M</i> is used. The total energy is shown as a dashed 
      line. The radial potential is calculated and traced when the simulation 
      is running. <i>U</i>_{eff} is obtained by subtracting the contribution 
      to the kinetic energies of the radial velocities, from the total energy 
      of the system.
